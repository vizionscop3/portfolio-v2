# Azure Static Web Apps Deployment Guide

## Overview

Your 3D portfolio is now configured for deployment to Azure Static Web Apps with a robust CI/CD pipeline.

## Deployment Configuration

### ‚úÖ What's Already Set Up

1. **Azure Static Web Apps Configuration** (`staticwebapp.config.json`)
   - SPA routing support with fallback to index.html
   - Proper caching headers for assets
   - Security headers (XSS protection, content-type sniffing protection)

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-happy-flower-01a9d340f.yml`)
   - Automated builds on push to main and phase-\* branches
   - Quality checks: TypeScript compilation, linting (with warnings allowed), tests
   - Optimized build process with manual build control
   - Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps

3. **Build Optimization**
   - Vite production build with code splitting
   - Vendor, router, and icons chunks for better caching
   - Source maps enabled for debugging
   - Asset optimization with immutable caching

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Ensure Azure Static Web App is Created

- Your workflow references `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_HAPPY_FLOWER_01A9D340F`
- Make sure this secret is configured in your GitHub repository settings

### 2. Push to Deploy

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: ready for Azure deployment with accessibility features

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin phase-7-performance-monitoring-system
```

### 3. Create Pull Request (Optional)

To deploy to main branch:

```bash
# Create PR to main for production deployment
gh pr create --title "Deploy Phase 7: Performance Monitoring and Accessibility" --body "Production deployment with comprehensive performance monitoring and accessibility features"
```

## Build Quality Status

‚úÖ **TypeScript Compilation**: Passes  
‚úÖ **Build Process**: Successful (1.4MB main bundle)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Linting**: 74 warnings (allowed, non-blocking)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Tests**: 2 minor test failures (LOD system tests, non-critical for deployment)

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Vendor (141KB), Router (18KB), Icons (14KB) chunks
- **Asset Caching**: 1-year cache for immutable assets
- **Gzip Compression**: ~400KB main bundle compressed
- **Source Maps**: Available for debugging

## Accessibility Features Included

- Reduced motion preferences
- High contrast mode
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Mobile accessibility optimizations
- Performance-aware accessibility (adapts to device capabilities)

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify these features work:

1. **3D Scene Loading**: Check that the cyberpunk room loads correctly
2. **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, 1-5 for sections)
3. **Performance**: Monitor FPS and loading times on various devices
4. **Mobile Experience**: Test responsive design and touch interactions
5. **Routing**: Verify deep links work correctly (refresh on any page)

## Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

- FPS tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Asset loading performance
- User interaction metrics
- Error tracking

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
2. Verify Azure Static Web Apps API token is valid
3. Ensure all required dependencies are in package.json
4. Check for TypeScript compilation errors

## Domain Configuration

To set up a custom domain:

1. Go to Azure Static Web Apps dashboard
2. Navigate to Custom domains
3. Add your domain and follow DNS configuration steps
4. Update Open Graph URLs in index.html
