### Phase 3: Phased Deployment Execution

#### Phase 1 Deployment: Core 3D Infrastructure

```yaml
Phase: 1
Environment: staging
Skip Tests: false
```

**Components Being Deployed:**

- Basic WebGL detection and capability assessment

- Infrastructure3D class with device detection
- Basic error handling for WebGL failures
- Performance monitoring foundation

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] WebGL initializes successfully on target browsers
- [ ] Basic 3D scene renders without errors
- [ ] Fallback system activates for unsupported devices
- [ ] Performance monitoring reports basic metrics

#### Phase 2-11 Incremental Deployments

Continue with each phase following the same pattern:

1. **Deploy to Staging**

   ```bash
   # GitHub Actions: Select phase and staging environment
   Phase: X, Environment: staging
   ```

2. **Validate Staging**
   - [ ] Health checks pass
   - [ ] Core functionality works
   - [ ] No critical errors in console
   - [ ] Performance meets targets

3. **Deploy to Production**

   ```bash
   # GitHub Actions: Select phase and production environment
   Phase: X, Environment: production
   ```

4. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - [ ] Production URL accessible
   - [ ] All features working as expected
   - [ ] Analytics tracking functional
   - [ ] SEO metadata correct

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Validation

### Real-Time Monitoring

- [ ] Azure Application Insights configured
- [ ] GitHub Actions build status monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] User accessibility testing

### Health Check Commands

```bash
# Pre-deployment health check
npm run health:check

# Phase-specific validation
npm run health:check -- --phase 1

# Post-deployment validation
node scripts/health-check.js --url https://portfolio-3d-interactive.azurestaticapps.net
```

### Rollback Procedures

```bash
# Automated rollback if deployment fails
node scripts/rollback.js full

# Manual rollback to specific phase
node scripts/rollback.js git deploy-phase-X

# List available rollback targets
node scripts/rollback.js list
```

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Commands Quick Reference

### Azure Infrastructure Setup

```powershell
# Full Azure setup
.\azure\deploy-azure.ps1

# Custom configuration
.\azure\deploy-azure.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "custom-rg" -SiteName "custom-site" -Location "West US 2"
```

### GitHub Actions Deployment

```yaml
# Manual workflow trigger parameters
workflow: Azure Deployment - Phased Rollout
inputs:
  phase: '1-11'
  environment: 'staging|production'
  skip_tests: false
```

### Health Checks and Validation

```bash
# Comprehensive health check
npm run health:check

# Build validation
npm run build && npm run health:check

# TypeScript and linting
npm run type-check && npm run lint
```

### Rollback and Recovery

```bash
# Emergency rollback
node scripts/rollback.js full
