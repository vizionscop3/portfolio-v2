- Check system integrity
- Identify immediate threats
- Evaluate data integrity
- Document current status

### Step 3: Impact Analysis

// turbo Determine scope of impact:

- Affected systems and components
- Data loss or corruption risk
- Security breach indicators
- User impact assessment

### Step 4: Stabilization

// turbo Secure and stabilize:

- Isolate affected components
- Implement temporary fixes
- Restore from backups if needed
- Establish communication channels

### Step 5: Documentation
