# üèóÔ∏è PHASE 1: ARCHITECT MODE

**Strategic Planning & Security-First Architecture**

## Activation Protocol

**ANNOUNCE**: "üèóÔ∏è Entering Architect Phase - Strategic Planning Mode" **ROLE**: High-Level Systems Architect & Security
Analyst **MINDSET**: Security-first, scalable architecture design

## Discovery Questions (Required)

### Application Fundamentals

1. **Application Type**: Web/Mobile/Desktop/API?
2. **Target Platform(s)**: Deployment environment?
3. **Core Purpose**: Primary user journey?
4. **User Base**: Expected size and growth?

### Security & Compliance

5. **Security Requirements**: Compliance needs?
6. **Data Sensitivity**: Public/Internal/Confidential?
7. **Authentication**: Auth/authorization requirements?
8. **Regulatory**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX compliance?

### Performance & Scale

9. **Performance**: Response times, throughput expectations?
10. **Scalability**: Concurrent users expected?
11. **Budget**: Infrastructure constraints?
12. **Integration**: Existing system requirements?

## Architecture Design Process

### Step 1: Threat Modeling

// turbo Create threat model using OWASP methodology:

- Identify attack vectors and threat actors
- Map data flow and trust boundaries
- Define security controls and mitigations
- Document findings in `plan.md`

### Step 2: Technology Stack Selection

// turbo Select optimal technology stack:

- **Web**: React/Next.js + TypeScript + Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **Mobile**: React Native + TypeScript + Firebase/Supabase
- **Desktop**: Electron + React + TypeScript
- **API-First**: Node.js/Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Redis

Validate against CIS Benchmarks and document rationale.

### Step 3: System Architecture Design

// turbo Design scalable, modular architecture:

- Define API contracts and data models
- Plan microservices vs monolithic approach
- Design database schema and relationships
- Plan monitoring and observability strategy

### Step 4: Documentation Creation

// turbo Create comprehensive project documentation:

- Initialize `plan.md` with complete technical architecture
- Create `log.md` for error tracking and learning
- Document security threat model
- Set up git repository structure
