# Custom Domain Setup for Azure Static Web Apps

## üö® Current Issue

Your custom domain `lifeofvizion.com` shows a 404 error because:

1. ‚úÖ DNS is correctly pointing to Azure (you see the Azure 404 page)
2. ‚ùå Custom domain is NOT configured in Azure Static Web Apps
3. ‚úÖ Static Web App routing configuration has been added

## üîß Solution Steps

### Step 1: Configure Custom Domain in Azure Portal

Since your Static Web App was created through GitHub Actions, you need to add the custom domain through the Azure
Portal:

1. **Go to Azure Portal**: https://portal.azure.com
2. **Find your Static Web App**:
   - Search for "Static Web Apps"
   - Look for a resource with hostname `happy-flower-01a5d2404.1.azurestaticapps.net`
3. **Add Custom Domain**:
   - Click on your Static Web App
   - In the left menu, click "Custom domains"
   - Click "+ Add"
   - Enter: `lifeofvizion.com`
   - Follow the verification process

### Step 2: Verify DNS Configuration

Make sure your DNS settings in Hostinger are correct:

**Required DNS Records:**

```
Type: CNAME
Name: @  (or lifeofvizion.com)
Value: happy-flower-01a5d2404.1.azurestaticapps.net
TTL: 3600
```

**Or use A Record if CNAME for apex domain isn't supported:**

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: [IP address provided by Azure]
TTL: 3600
```

### Step 3: Wait for Propagation

- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- Azure domain verification may take a few minutes
- Test with: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#CNAME/lifeofvizion.com

### Step 4: Alternative CLI Method (if you can find the resource)

If you can identify the exact Static Web App name and resource group:

```powershell
# Find the resource
az staticwebapp list --output table

# Add custom domain (replace with actual values)
az staticwebapp hostname set \
  --name "YOUR_STATIC_WEB_APP_NAME" \
  --resource-group "YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --hostname "lifeofvizion.com"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Check if deployment is working:

```
‚úÖ Default URL: https://happy-flower-01a5d2404.1.azurestaticapps.net
```

### Common Issues:

1. **Still seeing 404**: Domain not added to Azure Static Web Apps
2. **DNS errors**: Check Hostinger DNS configuration
3. **SSL issues**: Wait for Azure to provision SSL certificate

## üìã Next Steps After Domain Works

1. **Test the site thoroughly**
2. **Set up SSL certificate** (Azure handles this automatically)
3. **Configure redirect from www to apex domain** (if needed)
4. **Update any hardcoded URLs** in your application

## üÜò If Still Not Working

Try these diagnostic steps:

1. **Check current DNS**: `nslookup lifeofvizion.com`
2. **Verify in browser**: Open incognito/private browsing
3. **Clear DNS cache**: `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows)
4. **Check Azure deployment**: Look at GitHub Actions logs

The `staticwebapp.config.json` file has been added to handle routing correctly once the custom domain is configured.
