# Deployment Guide for Phase Feature

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for deploying the Phase feature of the portfolio application. It outlines the necessary steps to ensure a smooth deployment process.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that the main application is running without issues.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed and up to date.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Branch Creation**
   - Create a new branch for the Phase feature:
     ```
     git checkout -b phase-feature
     ```

2. **Build the Application**
   - Run the build command to compile the application:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```

3. **Testing**
   - Execute the tests to ensure that the Phase feature works as expected:
     ```
     npm test
     ```

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the application to the desired environment (e.g., staging or production). This may vary based on your hosting provider. For example, if using Azure, you might use:
     ```
     az webapp up --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --plan <app-service-plan>
     ```

5. **Verification**
   - After deployment, verify that the Phase feature is functioning correctly in the live environment. Check for any console errors and ensure that the UI behaves as expected.

6. **Rollback (if necessary)**
   - If issues are encountered, you can roll back to the previous stable version using:
     ```
     git checkout <previous-stable-branch>
     ```

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help ensure that the Phase feature is deployed successfully and operates as intended. Always monitor the application after deployment for any unforeseen issues.
